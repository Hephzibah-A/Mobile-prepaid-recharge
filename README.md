# Mobile Prepaid Recharge System

This project simulates a basic mobile prepaid recharge system, providing a command-line interface for users to recharge their mobile balances.

## Description

The `Mobile-prepaid-recharge` repository contains a website that is designed to model the core functionality of a mobile prepaid recharge system. It allows users to:

* Enter a mobile number to recharge.
* Select a recharge amount from a predefined list.
* Simulate a successful or failed recharge transaction.
* Display the updated mobile balance after a successful recharge.
* Handle invalid input and display appropriate error messages.

This project is a simplified representation of a real-world recharge system, focusing on the basic interaction and logic.
